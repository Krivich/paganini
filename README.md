## About Paganini Ukulele

Paganini Ukulele is a fun and engaging way to learn to play the ukulele! This browser-based game visually represents the ukulele fretboard and guides you through notes and chords. Instead of dry theory, you learn by doing, watching the notes fall, and playing along.

**Key Features:**

* **Interactive Fretboard:** A clear and responsive visual representation of the ukulele neck.
* **Falling Notes Gameplay:** Notes dynamically fall down the fretboard, indicating when to play.
* **Learn by Ear and Sight:** Develop your musical intuition by matching visual cues with sounds.
* **Beginner-Friendly:** Easy to pick up and play, even if you're new to the ukulele.
* **No Installation Required:** Play directly in your web browser.
* **Open Source:** Feel free to contribute and help make Paganini Ukulele even better!

## How to Play

1. **Visit the Website:** Go to [https://krivich.github.io/paganini/](https://krivich.github.io/paganini/).
2. **Observe the Falling Notes:**  Notes will appear and move down the fretboard.
3. **Play Along on Your Ukulele:** When a note reaches the top of the fret, play the corresponding note on your ukulele.
4. **Listen and Learn:** Pay attention to the sound of the played note and how it corresponds to the visual cue.

## Why "Paganini"?

Niccolò Paganini was a renowned virtuoso violinist. We named the game "Paganini Ukulele" to evoke the idea of mastering an instrument through dedicated practice and engagement – even in a playful way!
